## About

Senior Frontend Developer specializing in React, Vue, TypeScript, and modern ecosystem architecture. Currently building the **AI-VIBE-ECOSYSTEM v2.0** — a multi-product, agent-driven developer platform where frontend systems are designed for sovereign agents.

---

## 🏗️ What I’m Building

I am architecting **AI-VIBE-ECOSYSTEM v2.0**, a human-first developer platform where agents don't just write code—they collaborate within a unified system architecture. This ecosystem exists to bridge the gap between high-level intent and production-grade execution by treating AI as a first-class citizen in the developer's toolkit. This portfolio represents the **Senior Engineering lens** into that system, focusing on component design, state orchestration, and performance at scale.

---

## 🧩 The AI-VIBE Products (Senior Engineering Focus)

While the ecosystem spans 5 products, my work here focuses on the architectural standards across the platform:

- **AI-VIBE-WebBuilder**: Leading the "Generative UI" initiative. I focus on building the framework-agnostic component systems that agents use to construct production-ready applications.
- **AI-VIBE-ChatWeb**: Architecting the real-time streaming layer and shared state-machines for human-agent collaboration.
- **AI-VIBE-VSCode**: Ensuring IDE-grade performance for agent toolsets and IDE-to-cloud synchronization.
- *Integrations*: Deeply involved in the **Automation** and **CLI** layers to ensure a consistent developer experience across every product in the suite.

---

## ⚙️ How This Portfolio Fits the Ecosystem

This portfolio demonstrates the **Core Architecture & Standard** layer of the AI-VIBE-ECOSYSTEM. It showcases how we build robust, accessible, and maintainable frontend systems that agents can use without friction. It aligns with the **Design System → Component → Interaction** workflow, where agentic intent is translated into pixel-perfect, accessible UI.

---

## 🤖 Agents & Workflows I Use

In building this ecosystem, I leverage specialized agent workflows:
- **Component Architect**: Having agents generate variations of complex components based on design system rules.
- **Accessibility Auditor**: Using agents to verify WCAG compliance and focus management across dynamic agent-generated UI.
- **Refactoring Engine**: Leveraging agents to identify architectural debt and suggest modernization paths.

---

## 💎 Design & Quality Principles

- **Human-First Development**: AI handles the boilerplate; humans focus on the architecture. Our design system prioritizes agent-driven assembly with human-level polish.
- **Sovereign Systems**: Backend complexity is a design flaw. Frontend should be smart enough to handle agentic requests with high predictability.
- **Performance by Default**: Senior-level engineering means zero-latency for interaction and minimal bundle overhead, even in agent-heavy workflows.
- **Tradeoffs Accepted**: Choosing Vue & React for different parts of the ecosystem to prove that senior engineers can build high-quality solutions regardless of the framework.

## Additional Features (vNext)

Three focused additions signaling senior-level thinking:

### Design Decisions Section
**Why added:** Senior developers don't just build—they explain tradeoffs. Junior portfolios show pretty UI. Senior portfolios show thinking.

**What changed:** Added a dedicated Design Decisions section documenting key technical choices with rationale and explicit tradeoffs. Covers Vue 3 Composition API vs Options API, Pinia vs Vuex, Monorepo strategy, and H-RAG architecture. Shows I make intentional choices and understand their implications.

### Component Design Decisions
**Why added:** Each featured project should demonstrate architectural thinking.

**What changed:** Each featured project now includes a "Design Decisions" section listing 2-3 key tradeoffs. Examples: "Chose Composition API over Options API for better TypeScript inference" or "Used Zustand over Redux to reduce boilerplate." Shows I make intentional choices.

### Code Quality Signals
**Why added:** Production UI requires more than features—it's about maintainability.

**What changed:** Added quality indicators: TypeScript coverage, accessibility awareness, bundle size considerations. Honest numbers, not inflated metrics.

### Intentionally Rejected: Formal ADRs
I considered adding formal Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) for each project. Rejected because that's enterprise process, not portfolio material. The Design Decisions section conveys the same thinking without the formal template weight. Portfolios should show insights, not process documents.
